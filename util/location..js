// I don't have access to GOOGLE API's right now so I'll make a dummy function for now. Well fix this later xD

const getCordinates = (address)=> {
    // here we will call google api and pass it address so it will return us coordinates
    return {
        lat: 40.7484,
        lng: -73.9857,
    }
}

module.exports = getCordinates;
